# Vue.js pagination and search with ajax example

This is a simple JS app that does not use build tools like backpack.

What it does:

- Fetch data from a public REST API;
- Show that data in a table;
- Allows to paginate through the data in the table;
- Allows to search for the ID of a row.

You can see in action here: https://artenes.github.io/vuejs-pagination-search-ajax-example.

Or you can clone this repo and open the `index.html` in your browser.
